ðŸš€ Just Completed: Apna Bank - A Full-Scale Cash Transaction System! ðŸš€

Excited to share our latest project for the System Design and Architecture course: Apna Bank. The focus was on professional documentation, and we took on the challenge of coding the entire system in just 24 hours!

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js and Mongodb
Focus: Secure authentication & imaginative UI design
We built a modern, user-friendly interface and robust cash transaction functionalities while sharpening our HTML/CSS skills and mastering Node.js. This project provided an intense, hands-on experience in system design, combining technical precision with creative UI work.

Looking forward to applying these skills in future endeavors!
